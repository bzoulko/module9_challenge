# Module 9 Challenge - Command Line ReadMe.md File Generator
 To see what I can build with just command line input as the only source of input from the user.

## I built this application to assist in furthering my knowledge of full-stack developmenrt.

### I leanered it's not easy to only accept command prompt input and keep the application running smoothly.
 * Everything is controlled from a single set of array elements. * Using inquirer was not an easy task, I had to over come the async / await functionality. * Build the file itself was not easy, had to learn how 'fs' functioned and what methods to use.
