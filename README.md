# Module 09 Challenge Project - Node.js - Command Line ReadMe.md file Generator
This program is a command line, ReadMe.md file generator. Prompts for several key pieces
of detail regarding what should be included in a professional ReadMe file.


## Key elements in the generator.
* Everything is controlled from a single set of array elements. 

* Using inquirer was not an easy task, I had to over come the async / await functionality. 

* Build the file itself was not easy, had to learn how 'fs' functioned and what methods to use.


### Spoecial Notes:
* This application was quit challenging and required more concentration on how the JavaScript was
  coded. ASYNC and AWAIT played a crutial roll in making 'Inquirer' prompting to work efficiently
  for this application, since everything resided around Node.js and Terminal input.
